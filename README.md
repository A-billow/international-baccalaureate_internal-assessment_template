## Problem Question
How can we help the rats of New York City find (a) lifelong partner and companion(s)?

### Project Description
My clients are the rats of new york. I chose them because I notice they are always eating garbage in the street, and I spoke to a rat who told me they are really just looking for the love of their life, but until then stale bagels must keep them busy somehow. They'd really like to find a partner, though. That is this rat's dream, and they have many rat friends who feel the same way. I decided to build the rats the solution of their dreams in the form of a rat dating website. I think they are going to love it.
